The MV link:[linked text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcelgrGY1h8)
The reason why I chose this album is about the MV part, the producers were not only focus on the Idol group, but try to express their anti-patriarchy conception in every video.
And I chose this particular album is because that in this song "New Jeans", this team collbrated with the The Powerpuff Girls，I like the aesthetic design.
What's more, this MV mainly focus on the animation, and give me an inspiration of making a small interactive game.

 And the most impressive part of it is it brokes the Fourth wall by showing the production of Idol Industry.

That's a brave thing, the Idol group always considered as a character of selling the dreams, everyone is going to hide the brutal part of its 
capitalism, it not only contains the Idols' hardworking but reveals the ones who really build these towers. The producers behind the Idol industry is like the laborers who constructed skyscrapers in 20th century, people will remember who invested the bulding, but not ones who built it.
2. What aspect of the book will you include in your cover?
I will include this part:

It is interactive gam-like, I want to build a interactive page that will contain some story chapters.
3. Is it interactive? time-based? both?
It is interactive, but if I have time to finish it, hopefully it can be time-based, for instance, the sky can varies from the time, and maybe the gameplay also can change, add spotlight or so.
4. What ideas would you like to explore or experiment with?
I think I want to experiment with the 8-bit style and RPG games.
5. Are there aspects of your project that are related to any of the readings we’ve done?
I think it related HW04, about enhance the interactiveness of the album, not just one-way speech.
6. Include at least one drawing or sketch
I already reseached some design assets:
